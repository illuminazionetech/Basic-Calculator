# Basic-Calculator
I created a simple calculator in C++. It's not because I can't make more complex apps, but because I wanted to have some fun. Although it looks like a small app, it's actually a calculator that should work perfectly, at least for basic calculations. I haven't tested more complex equations yet, so feel free to try them out and see how it goes. If you want, you can also fork it to improve it or add a graphical interface.
